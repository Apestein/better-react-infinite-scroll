Intended to be a complete guide to infinite scroll in React. Nothing to install, just copy/paste and customize. Meant to be used with Tanstack Query.

I made this component because I found other solutions such as [react-finite-scroll-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) and [react-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller) was large, written as class component, and unnecessarily hard to customize.
